## 4. Finding and Eliminating Errors

The **interactive debugger** is also a magic function but I have given it a category of its own. If you get an exception while running the code cell, type `%debug` in a new line and run it. This opens an interactive debugging environment which brings you to the position where the exception has occurred. You can also check for values of variables assigned in the program and also perform operations here. To exit the debugger hit `q`.
